This project is a full refresh of my personal site.  I usually do one of these every 3-5 years to
relearn some frontend work.  Though, this time it was entirely done with vibe coding, and some
manual fixes.  It's nice to be able to express it simply, but it does take some of the hands off
learning that comes with it.

I used Tanstack Start for this project, to skip out on Next.js, especially after all the recent
vulnerabilities.  And I ensured to try out some new designs to make it nice and clean, though
there are some unideal designs that can be cleaned up (and also GPT always makes these weird neon
purple pages).
