  <strong>Why spend the time to rebuild my website?</strong>
  <p>
    I wanted to spend some time tinkering with vibe coding, and having a platform for
    experimentation.  Also, just to a place to give thoughts about software development
    in general, and things I may be thinking of in the future.
  </p>
</div>

This is the first post on the rebuilt site. The goal is to make publishing
lightweight and keep the focus on the work itself rather than the tooling.

## What is new

- A clean-slate design and layout system
- MDX-driven writing with reusable components
- Performance-first defaults and accessible navigation

## What technology does this use?

It uses Tanstack Start, which I've been testing out as a replacement for Next.js, as I don't
like being tied to one provider (Vercel).
