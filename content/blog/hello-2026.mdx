<Callout title="Why the rebuild?">
  I wanted a modern foundation that makes it easy to publish, fast to load,
  and flexible enough to grow with new projects and writing.
</Callout>

This is the first post on the rebuilt site. The goal is to make publishing
lightweight and keep the focus on the work itself rather than the tooling.

## What is new

- A clean-slate design and layout system
- MDX-driven writing with reusable components
- Performance-first defaults and accessible navigation

If there is a topic you want covered, reach out on social and I will add it to
the queue.
