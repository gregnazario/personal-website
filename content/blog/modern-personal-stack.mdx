Building a personal site is a chance to experiment with new ideas without
compromising on quality. My focus areas are simple:

## Content that ships fast

MDX keeps writing close to the codebase without the overhead of a separate CMS.
I can iterate quickly while still having room for custom components.

## Performance as a product feature

Static-first rendering, fast fonts, and image optimization make the site feel
instant. It is also great for search, sharing, and long-term maintenance.

## Room to grow

The foundation is ready for talks, case studies, and deeper project updates
over time. The content system makes that easy to expand.
